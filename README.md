*Analysis of thesaurus-annotated genomic variants in R*

&nbsp;


Thesaurus annotation is a method for elucidating ambiguities 
in calling genomic variants in genomic regions of low mappability. 

To produce thesaurus annotations for a sample, see java software 
GeneticThesaurus on [github] (https://github.com/tkonopka/GeneticThesaurus) 
or [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/geneticthesaurus/).

This repository contains a complementary R package - RGeneticThesaurus. 
The package provides a set of tools to manipulate thesaurus annotations in the 
R environment. Notably, it provides tools to compare sets of variant 
calls and to identify changes in allelic frequencies in matched samples.

See the package [vignette](https://github.com/tkonopka/RGeneticThesaurus/blob/master/inst/doc/RGeneticThesaurus-vignette.md)
for an example analysis.
